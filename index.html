              <p>Interpreter by profession, sociologist from the guts, but a developing full-stack developer by heart. I have been changing paths every so often that I cannot longer say that I have a stable profession, nor I want to really have it. The only tag that I won’t be able to change is the parent one.</p>
              <p>In the beginning I wanted to become a Historian, but enrolled in Graphic Design school. Thinking that it wasn’t my real persona, I gave it a second though and decided to get into Social Sciences, not without glimpsing a Computer Engineering flavor. </p>
              <p>After finishing my degree, I decided to not work in that field but in a computing powerhouse, Hewlett-Packard… but it in Payroll, not much fun.
                  Meeting my wife, I left Mexico to change career once again, using a skill that I was a pastime during my teens, learning languages.</p>
              <p>Now, I find myself exploring a new path once again, but now combining everything I’ve worked, studied and dreamt… a new language, related to design, involving computers. Let this one be the best experience, yet!</p>
